    <p>
      A &quot;hierarchical spreadsheet&quot; that is a great replacement for spreadsheets, mind mappers, outliners, PIMs, text editors and small databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suitable for any kind of data organization, such as todo lists, calendars, project management, brainstorming, organizing ideas, planning, requirements gathering, presentation of information, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      It&apos;s like a spreadsheet, immediately familiar, but much more suitable for complex data because it&apos;s hierarchical. It&apos;s like a mind mapper, but more organized and compact. It&apos;s like an outliner, but in more than one dimension. It&apos;s like a text editor, but with structure.
